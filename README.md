# MLSTProject-ORISE

This repository holds the scripts created as part of the MLST project I am contributing to as an ORISE fellow at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

### Goals:
- Test multiple allele callers suitable for foodborne pathogens as part of an on-going project in the Enteric Diseases Laboratory Branch (EDLB).
- Utilize open source tools and assess their compatibility in terms of optimum loci detection with an internal dataset.
- Evaluate  the viability and ease of running the allele calling tools, to ensure the output meets the project requirements.
